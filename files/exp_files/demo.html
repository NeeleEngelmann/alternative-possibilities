    <br>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/tom.png" width = 20%></img></p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Tom was known for his tireless dedication to social causes. Environmental responsibility was a key aspect of Tom’s moral compass. He consistently made sustainable choices, embracing practices such as recycling, composting, and reducing his carbon footprint. Tom advocated for renewable energy and educated others on the importance of protecting the planet for future generations.<br> 
    <br>
    Tom consistently demonstrated unwavering compassion and empathy towards others. He actively volunteered at local charities, and supported marginalized communities. In his personal life, he prioritized open and honest communication, always strove to treat others with respect and fairness. Tom’s friends and family remember his integrity, his unwavering support and his drive to stand up for what is right, even in difficult situations.<br>
    <br>
    Tom’s positive outlook and resilience in the face of challenges inspired those around him. His everyday acts of compassion, whether lending a helping hand to those in need or practicing random acts of kindness, had a ripple effect on those around him, encouraging them to follow suit.<br>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/tom.png" width = 20%></img></p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Tom was known for his complete disregard for ethical principles. In his pursuit of power and success, he was willing to trample over anyone who stood in his way, using dishonest and exploitative practices to achieve his goals. Tom lacked the ability to genuinely connect with others on an emotional level, viewing them solely as tools to further his own agenda.<br>
    <br>
    In his personal life, Tom’s interactions were marked by callousness and indifference. He consistently manipulated and exploited those around him for personal gain, showing no remorse for the suffering he inflicted on others. Whether it was deceiving people for financial advantage or manipulating their emotions for his own amusement, Tom's moral compass was deeply distorted.<br>
    <br>
    Tom’s acquaintances remember his consistent pattern of dishonesty, betrayal, and complete lack of accountability. He was unapologetic about his actions and refused to take responsibility for the harm he caused, deflecting blame onto others and manipulating situations to his advantage.<br>

    <br>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Tom was an individual who led an unremarkable and somewhat mundane life. He possessed features that were neither striking nor memorable, with an average build and an unremarkable appearance that often went unnoticed.<br>
    <br>
    His wardrobe consisted of plain and practical clothing, lacking any sense of style or individuality. In his day-to-day routine, Tom fulfilled his obligations responsibly, but he occasionally displayed a tendency to be overly cautious and stingy with his money.<br>
    <br>
    In conversations, he engaged in polite but unmemorable exchanges, rarely offering insightful or engaging remarks. Tom pursued a range of hobbies and interests, although his lack of passion or expertise in any specific area made him appear somewhat uninteresting.<br>
